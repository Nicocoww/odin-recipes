    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound beef tenderloin</li>
      <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>
      <li>2 anchovies</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>4 cups baby arugula</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup capers</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>baguette slices for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wrap beef very tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer until just slightly firm, about 1 hour. Chill 4 large plates in the refrigerator until ready to serve. </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare sauce. Combine mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, anchovies, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until smooth and set aside.</li>
      <li>Remove plastic wrap from beef. Using a very sharp knife, carefully slice paper-thin slices of beef. Arrange beef in a single layer divided among 4 chilled plates.</li>
      <li>Toss arugula with remaining lemon juice and pepper, olive oil, and salt. Place arugula mixture in the center of the beef.  Drizzle evenly with reserved sauce; sprinkle with capers and cheese. Serve immediately with baguette slices.</li>
    </ol>
