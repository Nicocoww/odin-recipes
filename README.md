# TOP Project: Recipes
This is my first project on GitHub!

I love Italian food so it was only natural I used Italian recipes!
Initially, I wanted to tackle all 3 courses, but ended being too lazy as I figured it would be repetitive.

So there are 3 recipes currently (instead of 9!) and I'm quite happy with the results.

One feature I added that was not required by the curriculum is the added navigation. On recipe pages, you can easily go back to main menu or other recipe pages of the same category.

I can't wait to learn how to style with CSS!
